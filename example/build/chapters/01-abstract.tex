\section*{Abstract}
PyThesis is a lightweight Python framework that lets you integrate Python code into \LaTeX documents. The framework consists of two components: A web React application that can be used to quickly build and view the final PDF document and a Python backend that acts as a preprocessor for the \LaTeX code and embedded Python code. The framwork also contains classes that can be used to interact with a shared MathWorks MATLAB session. Specifically, datasets can be loaded using the Python CSV loader and then sent to MATLAB for further processing or to generate plots. The resulting graphics can be stored in a predefined directory in order to directly embed them as \LaTeX figures.
