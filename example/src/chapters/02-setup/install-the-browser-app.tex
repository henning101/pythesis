\section{Install the Browser App}
The browser app is written using the React framework. Node.js needs to be installed to generate a build: \url{https://nodejs.org} 
\begin{verbatim}
cd app
npm install
npm run build
\end{verbatim}
This generates a static build that is served by the integrated Python Flask server.
