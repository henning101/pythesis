\section{Install npm to modify the Browser App (Optional)}

\textbf{The prebuild app is now part of the repository. You can skip this unless you want to modify the app}

The browser app is written using the React framework. Node.js needs to be installed to generate a build: \url{https://nodejs.org} 
\begin{verbatim}
cd app
npm install
npm run build
\end{verbatim}
This generates a static build that is served by the integrated Python Flask server.
