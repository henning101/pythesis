\section{Run PyThesis}
In Windows you can click on the run\_example.bat to start the example. The webapp should open in a new browser window. Using the command line, the software can be started as follows: 
\begin{verbatim}
python start.py --project_root <project_root>
\end{verbatim}
On Linux use python3 instead. <project\_root> should be replaced with an absolute project path. In order to test the framework and the browser app point <project\_root> to the example project. A new project should match the layout of the example.
