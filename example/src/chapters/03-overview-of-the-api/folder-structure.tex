\section{Folder Structure}
\label{sec:folder-structure}
PyThesis uses the following for a project:
\begin{verbatim}
build/ 
data/
src/
templates/
\end{verbatim}
\textbf{build} stores the combined, transpiled tex file as well as \LaTeX output files such as the generated PDF. \textbf{data} should hold CSV files that can be loaded using the Dataset class or \_matlab. \textbf{src} should store all \LaTeX and Python source files. \\

\textbf{NOTE: DO NOT EDIT SOURCE FILES IN THE build FOLDER. THEY WILL GET OVERWRITTEN. ALSO .tex FILES IN \_tex FOLDERS UNDER src ARE OVERWRITTEN.} \\

The \emph{templates} folder should contain reusable templates along with their default JSON files.
